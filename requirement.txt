In general, we use cookies and similar technologies to help us better serve you and improve your experience on our Site. As you browse areas of the Innovative Technology Strategies Inc. Network and view emails from us, cookies may be placed on your computer’s hard drive and/or your mobile device which may allow us to collect information, such as your internet protocol address and mobile device identifier. Cookies allow us to track your account so you don’t need to retype the information each time you visit our Site. Cookies also allow us to provide certain services and features to you. You may refuse cookies in your browser, but doing so may result in certain services and features not functioning properly. We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads and/or collect certain information when you visit our Site. These advertisers may also serve cookies when you click on advertisements on the Site, or use pixel tags, web beacons, or similar technologies, including within email advertisements we send on their behalf, to collect non-personally identifiable aggregated information when users visit the Site in order to provide advertisements on our Site, other sites, and other forms of media about goods and services that may be of interest to you. This common practice is known as “online behavioral advertising” or “interest based advertising”. To learn more about this practice or to opt-out of this use of your information, click here. In addition, if you want to prevent a third-party advertiser from collecting data, you may visit each ad network’s web site individually and opt-out. We do not have access to personal information, if any, gathered by advertisers.
We also use the third-party analytics service Google Analytics to help analyze how users use our Site. The information generated by cookies or other tracking technologies about your use of our Site is transmitted to Google Analytics, which uses such non-personally identifiable information to compile reports on user activity. We may connect such information to other data that we have about the user. Google Analytics’ ability to use and share this analytics information is restricted by its terms of use and privacy policy. By using our Site, you consent to Google Analytics using your data in the manner and for the purposes described above.

Network. These sites are maintained by third parties not controlled by Innovative Technology Strategies Inc.
